Welcome to 'THE MAZE'!.

This is my first game made using python.

the game is played using the terminal.

Controls:

Move: Left, Right, Up, Down arrow keys to move.
P: to exit the game.


The name of the maze is to be provided using the command line arguments.

command line syntax: python main.py [maze file]

All the maze are stored in the mazes directory.

'S' is the user and 'E' is the endpoint.

You can also add your own maze made of hashes and try it out!

Note: Do not put the endpoint 'E' at the edges of the maze because the user 'S' cannot move on the very last row/column.

If anyone has ideas as to how it can be fixed, please use fork. 


Hope you like it.
Thanks,
Mohammed.
